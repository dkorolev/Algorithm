Brainfuck Developer is freeware. You may distribute it freely, but
only in "complete and unchanged state". Developer is "complete" with the
three files bfdev.exe, printer.b, and readme.txt, bundled in the original
bfdev.zip file. Please do not upload BFdev to your website but link to
my site.

FREEWARE DOES NOT MEAN PUBLIC DOMAIN OR OPEN SOURCE. I HOLD ALL RIGHTS.
